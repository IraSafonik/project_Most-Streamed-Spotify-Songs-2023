Songs with a single artist have a lower average energy percentage (62.12%) compared to songs with multiple artists. This might indicate that solo performances tend to have more varied energy levels, possibly due to a broader range of musical styles.
The energy percentage generally increases as the number of contributing artists increases, with a peak mean energy percentage of 75.33% for songs with six artists.
Consistency in Energy Levels:

The standard deviation for energy percentage decreases as the number of artists increases, especially noticeable for songs with more than four artists. This suggests that songs with more artists tend to have more consistent energy levels.
Notably, songs with six artists have the lowest standard deviation (4.16), indicating very similar energy levels across these tracks.
Range of Energy Levels:

The range of energy levels is widest for solo artist tracks (9% to 97%), reflecting greater variability in solo performances.
For groups with more artists, the range becomes narrower, indicating that collaborative efforts might lead to more harmonized and consistent energy outputs.
Median Energy Levels:

The median energy percentage increases with the number of artists, with songs involving five or six artists showing the highest median energy levels (72% and 74%, respectively).
This indicates that collaborative songs tend to maintain a higher baseline energy compared to solo tracks.

#### Summary:
The analysis reveals that songs with more contributing artists generally exhibit higher and more consistent energy percentages. Solo performances, while having a broader range of energy levels, tend to have a lower average energy. This could be due to the diverse nature of solo artists' music compared to the potentially more harmonized output of collaborative tracks. These insights can be valuable for understanding how the number of contributing artists influences the overall energy and consistency of popular songs.

### Conclusions Based on Correlation Heatmap
<img width="972" alt="–ó–Ω—ñ–º–æ–∫ –µ–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2024-05-16 –æ 17 55 01" src="https://github.com/IraSafonik/project_Most-Streamed-Spotify-Songs-2023/assets/32171563/e027b702-3e53-4603-9556-8ddc1e2cb81d">

#### Based on the correlation heatmap, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- Some attributes have weak correlation: For example, artist_count does not exhibit significant correlation with most other features in the dataset, except for a weak correlation with danceability_% and valence_%.

- Some attributes show moderate correlation: For instance, released_year demonstrates moderate correlation with some other attributes such as in_spotify_playlists, in_apple_playlists, and in_deezer_charts.

- Some attributes exhibit strong correlation: For example, energy_% and valence_% show moderate correlation with each other, suggesting that energetic songs may have a more positive mood.

# Summary 
### Based on the analysis performed, several overarching conclusions can be drawn:

#### Dataset Overview: 
The dataset covers various music industry aspects comprehensively, including song features, artist details, release information, and platform presence.

#### Temporal Trends: 
Recent years, notably 2023, see a substantial increase in song releases, reflecting a dynamic music scene during this period.

#### Correlation Insights: 
Correlation analysis reveals varying degrees of association between attributes, guiding the identification of influential factors driving overall trends.
